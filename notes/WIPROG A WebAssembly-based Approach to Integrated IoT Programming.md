# WIPROG: A WebAssembly-based Approach to Integrated IoT Programming

### problem

Programming a complete IoT application usually requires separated programming for device, edge and/or cloud sides, which slows down the development process and makes the project hardly portable

two remain solutions:

+ TinyLink: integrated programing, using a single coherent language(still have problem: cannot code offloading among different runtime, code is not fully portale)
+ Installing a new runtime engine(still have problem: too huge for IoT devices)

### WIPROG

a novel approach to integrated IoT programming motivated by WebAssembly
