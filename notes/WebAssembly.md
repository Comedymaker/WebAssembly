# WebAssembly (Wasm)

WebAssembly is a new type of code that can be run in modern web browsers — it is a low-level assembly-like language with a compact binary format that runs with near-native performance and provides languages such as C/C++, C# and Rust with a compilation target so that they can run on the web. It is also designed to run alongside JavaScript, allowing both to work together.

##### Why wasm can be used in the Edge Computing

+ 跨平台（多设备支持）
+ 高性能，低功耗
+ 移植性（多语言支持）
+ 安全性（沙盒执行环境）

##### WebAssembly System Interface (Wasi)

+ WASI stands for WebAssembly System Interface. It's an API designed by the [Wasmtime](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime) project that provides access to several operating-system-like features, including files and filesystems, Berkeley sockets, clocks, and random numbers, that we'll be proposing for standardization.
